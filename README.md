# FLARE
Forced Labor Automated Risk Estimator, a supply chain classifier

This classifer depends on data that I can share with others with the implementation of a Data Sharing Agreement (it is generally permissive, but my organization requires it so we don't get sued). For a copy of the underlying data, email me at shannon at gfems dot org.
